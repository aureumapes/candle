Candle
======

Candle is a simple esoteric research programing language. Built using [Go](https://go.dev) and featuring a well-crafted instruction set, it provides fast execution time and produces easy-to-read code.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please keep in mind that the project is in its alpha stage. Bugs, crashes, and missing features are expected. The instruction set is also incomplete and features undefined behavior.

‚úè Language features
-------------------

*   line-by-line execution and interpretation, where instruction has its line
*   strings and 64-bit float as datatypes
*   Comments, introduced with `//`, only working in a line
*   [Functions](#functions)

üì© Installation
------------
### Arch based Distos
Use a aur-helper of your choice, I use yay:
`yay -S candle`<br>
OR of course build it manually:
`git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/candle.git && cd candle && makepkg -si`

### Other Distors
1. Download the repo: `git clone https://github.com/aureumapes/candle.git`
2. Build the source: `cd candle && go build`
3. Copy the candle-binary where you can execute it


üìé Instructions
---------------

Candle features a variety of instructions for you to use in your programs

### Set

The set instruction allows you to set a value of a variable. If the variable name wasn't previously defined a new variable will be created, otherwise, the value of the variable will be overridden by the new one. The set instruction allows for inserting a variable as a value. If you want to set an string as the value, add the prefix `+` to the value. Variable names must follow the RegEx `[a-z][a-z|0-9]*`  
Example: `set pi to 3.14`, `set x to y`, `set hi to +Hello World`

### Say

With the say instruction, you can print a variable or string to the console. Prefix strings as input with a `+` like `say +Hello World`, otherwise the interpreter will interpret `Hello World` as a variable name.  
Example: `say x`, `say +Hello World`

### Sayln

Sayln is the same as the say instruction but will append a new line character at the end of the message.  
Example: `sayln x`, `sayln +Hello World`

### Ask

Wanted to ask for input. The `ask` instruction is your go-to option. It follows the syntax `ask <variable> <message>` where the variable is the variable name to store the input in (if not available a new one will be created) and the message is the message asked in the console.  
Example: `ask pi What is pi equal to?`

### Read
Read saves the content of a file into a variable<br/>
Example: `read main.cndl cat`

### Add

The add instruction is used to clalculate the sum of a Variable and anouther Variable or Number. The result will override the value of the first variable.  
Example: `add a -5`, `add a b`

### Sub, Mul, Div

These instructions do the same as add but instead calculate the difference, product, or quotient of the variable and the other variable or number.  
Example: `sub a 8`, `mul a 5`, `div a 2`

### If

With if you can execute a command if a variable is ==, !=, <=, >=, < or > to another variable or other value  
Example: `if a == 9 sayln +a is equal to 9`

### Functions

The `function` keyword initiates functions. You end the function body with the `end` keyword.  
The body will be executed, when the function is created and when the fuction name is called in a line, as a instruction.  
Example:  
`function main`<br />
`sayln +Hello World`<br />
`end` <br />
`main`

### Import
`import` reads another candle file and writes it into a function in your current program<br/>
Make sure to give the File name without the extension(.cndl)<br/>
Examples:
`import hello-world`
